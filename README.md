# Music controller party app

## A fullstack Django + React (TypeScript) project

Started in September 2022, still in progress.

### This is a learning project I am working on to fuse two technologies I am familiar with (Django and React) into one application, as well as learn TypeScript along the way.

Technologies used:

-   Python (3.10)
-   Django (4.0.7)
-   TypeScript (4.8.3)
-   React (18.2.0)

Additional tools (for versions see _partyapp/frontend/package.json_):

-   Babel
-   Material UI
-   Webpack
