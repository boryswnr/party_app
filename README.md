2. open terminal and navigate to __partyapp__ folder. You know you are there if there is a manage.py file in the folder you are in;
3. in terminal run command:
  __on windows:__
      `python manage.py runserver`
  __on linux/macos:__
      `python3 manage.py runserver`
4. terminal should display a localhost link, most likely _http://127.0.0.0.1:8000/_. Open your web browser on this page.
5. To test the app, you will need a spotify premium account. If you want to test room as a guest, join the room you created in a private browser window.
